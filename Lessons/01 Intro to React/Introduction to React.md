From the [Official React documentation](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html):
> React is a **declarative**, efficient, and flexible JavaScript **library** for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

React's power comes from allowing us to create reusable components, composing those components, and handles rendering
those components and an efficient and optimized way (we'll get more into that in a bit).

Because React is (partially) built
with [functional programming](https://opensource.com/article/17/6/functional-javascript)
concepts in mind, and we are going to making functional components, we need to keep FP concepts in mind. A side effect
can be any change from inside the component, which alters the global environment, or anything outside the scope of a
component. *Side effects can cause bugs, and make testing difficult.*
